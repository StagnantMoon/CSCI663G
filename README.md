# CSCI663G
Final Project for CSCI 663

Final Project is combination.py

I combined des.py and diffihellman.py into a gui to perform encryption and to show how Diffie-Hellman is used.


RSA.py is a simple RSA encryption Program 
diffiehellman.py is a simple Diffie-Hellman Example
des.py is a simple des encryption


Nothing Fancy. Just learning how to do this for future career prospects
Install:
pip install pycryptodome
pip install cryptography
